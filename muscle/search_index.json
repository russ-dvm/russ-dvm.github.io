Within each myofiber are many tightly packed myofibrils, which are composed of actin and myosin filaments, and which form the contractile machinery of the muscle. It is the arrangment of myofibrils that form the striated appearance of skeletal muscle that can be appreciated under light microscopy (Figure 1.2). The cytoplasm of a myofiber is known as the sarcoplasm, while the cell membrane is called the sarcolemma. Each myofiber is surrounded by a small amount of connective tissue called the endomysium. Multiple myofibers form a fasicle that is surrounded by another layer of connective tissue, the perimysium. Finally, multiple fasicles group together to form a muscle. Figure 1.1: Structure and anatomy of muscle Figure 1.2: Normal skeletal muscle demonstrating striations. The arrow indicates a small capillary. Skeletal muscle is characteristically multinucleated: each myofiber has 100s of nuclei scattered along its length, almost always found along the periphery of the cell. Each nucleus within a myofiber controls a specific portion of the myofiber, and each nucleus acts independently. Nuclei within muscle fibers are terminally differentiated, meaning they can no longer divide, thus limiting the capacity for regeneration. On the other hand, having multiple nuclei within a cell provides a distinct benefit: localized damage, affecting a small number of nuclei, will not necessarily kill the entire cell, giving the myofiber an opportunity to regenerate. We will discuss muscle regeneration in more detail in the section on Necrosis and regeneration. Closely associated with individual myofibers are satellite cells. The nuclei of satellite cells are indistinguishable from myofiber nuclei under light microscopy. Satellite cells are a type of stem cell, and are important in muscle regeneration and repair. Myofibers can be subclassified based on certain properties that reflect their function. The classification is based on three physiologic properties: Rate of contraction (fast vs. slow) Rate of fatigue (fast vs. slow) Type of metabolism (oxidative, glycolytic, or mixed) Taking these characteristics into consideration leads to three subtypes: Type 1, Type 2a, and Type 2b (Table 1.1). Note that muscles are rarely, if ever, composed of a single subtype: they are a mixture of the different subtypes, though one type often predominates. Table 1.1: Properties of different myofiber types Fiber.type Physiologic.characteristics Morphologic.characteristics Examples Type 1 slow twitch, fatigue resistant, oxidative, aerobic, ‘red’ High mitochondrial and fat content, low glycogen Muscles involved in prolonged activity, e.g. postural muscles, diaphragm Type 2a Fast twitch, oxidative, glycolytic, fatigue resistant Intermediate mitochondria, fat, and glycogen content Type 2b Fast twitch, fatigue sensitive, glycolytic, ‘white’ Low mitochondrial and fat content, high glycogen Muscles involved in athletic acitivty, e.g. sprinting 1.2 The function of muscle The contraction of muscle is a complex, orchestrated process in which myofilaments (the components of myofibrils) undergo a conformational change that results. The contraction of muscle is initiated at the motor end plate by the release of acetylcholine from a motor neuron into the neuromuscular junction. This depolarizes the myofiber, resulting in the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. It is the binding of calcium to the myofilament tropononin that results in the contraction of the sarcomere. Importantly, calcium must be pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum in an ATP-dependent process. Once this occurs, the muscle enters into a relaxed, resting state. 1.3 Response of muscle to injury Skeletal muscle can undergo a fairly limited range of changes in response to environmental and physiologic stimuli. Muscle can shrink (atrophy), get bigger (hypertrophy), or die (necrosis). Under certain circumstances, muscles that have been only mildly injured can regenerate. The reaction of muscle to injury tends to proceed in a fairly sterotypic fashion regardless of the inciting cause, making it difficult to determine the underlying etiology from gross or histopathological exmaination alone. Thus, it is important to provide a good clinical history when submitting a case with suspected muscle injury. Supplementary tests (special stains, culture, etc.) are also often necessary to obtain a definitive diagnosis. 1.3.1 Atrophy Atrophy simply refers to the reducing in volumne of muscle or myofiber, and is usually reversible, provided the cause can be corrected. 1.3.1.1 Denervation atrophy Denervation atrophy is caused by the loss of a nerve that innervates a myofiber. It is rapid, severe, relatively common, and can result in the loss of more than half of the affected muscle mass in a matter of weeks. The maintenance of a normal myofiber diameter is reliant in part on an intact associated nerve, which generates trophic factors. Loss of a nerve leads to loss of the trophic factors, and results in atrophy. Interestingly, it is not a factor of contractile activity: disorders such as [Botulism] or [Tetanus] that affect the neuromuscular junction do not lead to atrophy. Denervation atrophy tends to affect affect both type 1 and 2 myofibers. Examples of disorders caused by denervation atrophy include [Equine laryngeal hemiplegia (“roaring”)], [“Sweeney”], [Equine motor neuron disease], [Equine protozoal myeloencephalitis], and [Radial nerve paralysis]. 1.3.1.2 Disuse atrophy Decreased contractile activity of a muscle for any reason leads to disuse atrophy. Common causes include lameness/pain or limb immobilization (e.g. cast), and it tends to occur more gradually then denervation atrophy. Disuse atrophy preferentially leads to atrophy of type 2 fibers, however, this is somewhat inconsistent, thus relying solely on type 2 atrophy to distinguish this from denervation atrophy is risky. Because the muscle fibers undergoing disuse atrophy are not being used, there is no compensatory hyertrophy. 1.3.1.3 Nutritional (malnutrition or cachexia) atrophy Failure to supply enough dietary nutrients to maintain normal muscle mass leads to nutritional atrophy. It is a gradual form of muscle loss and tends to be generalized, though in the dog, loss of the temporal, back, and thigh muscles are often prominent. Muscle proteins undergo continuous turnover, and in states of starvation, can be used as a source of nutrients. Cachectic animals with chronic illness or neoplasia lose muscle mass due to increased circulating levels of TNF (also known as “cachectin”), which increases myofiber catabolism. Type 2 fibers are preferentially affected. 1.3.1.4 Atrophy of endocrine disease This is a relatively specific category of atrophy, most commonly noted in dogs with hypothyroidism or hyperadrenocorticism. Type II fibers are preferentially affected. 1.3.2 Hypertrophy Hypertrophy refers to grossly enlarged muscles, or to histologically enlarged myofibers. It does not refer to an increase in number of myofibers. It can be the result of physiologic stimulation or pathologic processes. Physiologic hypertrophy is generally the result of increased workload on the muscle. Pathologic hypertrophy occurs in response to a number of conditions. Compensatory hypertrophy of unaffected myofibers can occur in a background of neuropathic or myopathic atrophy. 1.3.3 Necrosis and regeneration Myofiber necrosis is a non-specific finding that can accompany a variety of different diseases and conditions. Grossly, necrosis of muscle is usually only appreciated in severe cases. Necrotic muscle is typically pale to white, and may appear streaked and slightly gritty if mineralization has occurred (for example, in [White muscle disease])(Figure 1.3). Necrotic muscle can alternatively appear deeply red, if hemorrhage has occurred concurrently. Figure 1.3: Necrosis of the myocardium. Pale white streaks bordered by hemorrhage are visible throughout the ventricle. Photo: C. Martin The outcome of muscle necrosis is dependent on its severity. If the basal lamina remains intact, and the damage only affects a small portion of the myofiber, then muscle can regenerate. The basal lamina is a thin layer of extracellular matrix that keeps satellite cells closely associated to the myofiber, and just importantly, keeps fibroblasts out. The steps in muscle regeneration are fairly straightforward: Segmental necrosis Invasion of the sarcoplasm by circulating monocytes, which differentiate into macrophages. Macrophages phagocytose cellular debris, “cleaning” up the sarcoplasm. Satellite cells enter the sarcoplasm and migrate towards the center of the of the myofiber. Satellite cells divide and form a tube (“myotube”) which produces sarcoplasm. The myotube extends to the edges of the damaged myofiber. The myotube expands, though is still narrower than the unaffected myofiber. A row of nuclei appear in the center of the regenerating myofiber, and sarcomeres begin to form. Note that if the basal lamina has been destroyed, or if the damage affects a large area, then healing occurs via fibrosis (scarring). Although myofiber nuclei themselves cannot divide, recall that each myofiber is accompanied by satellite cells, which can divide and differentiate into myofibers. Segmental necrosis and regeneration occur following a variety of insults, most commonly metabolic, nutritional (e.g. [White muscle disease], toxic (e.g. [Ionophore toxicity])). Determining the etiology of the damage can therefore be quite difficult. It is helpful to observe the temporal pattern of the damage: are all muscle fibers at the same stage of necrosis or regeneration, suggesting a single, massive insult? Or is there a range of changes, with some fibers showing early stages of necrosis, and others at the end of regeneration, which suggests an on-going injury? These temporal changes are known as monophasic (occuring at one point) or polyphasic (an on-going proceess). These can be further classified by the commonly used distribution modifiers: focal, locally extensive, multifocal, or diffuse, to help narrrow down the etiology. For example, a focal, monophasic injury is more likely to be traumatic in origin than metabolic, while a multifocal, polyphasic injury could be due to the on-going lack of a nutritional requirement, as seen in [White muscle disease]. 1.4 Gross evaluation of muscle Although important, the gross examination of muscles during a necropsy can be underwhelming, and if muscular disease is suspected, samples of muscle should always be submitted for histopathology. During a gross examination of a carcass, muscles should be evaluated for changes in size, texture, and colour. Muscles can be bigger (hypertrophied) or, more commonly, smaller (atrophied), or normal. Difficulty in assessing the normal size of muscles for different species and breeds can be aided by comparing with normal animals, or, if unilateral disease is present, with the contralateral side. Changes in the colour of muscle are common, are often artifactual, and are dependent on blood perfusion, age, and species. Possible colour changes, along with potential causes, are listed below. Pale muscles: Normal in young animals Common in anemic animals Can be due to necrosis (ischemic) Denervation If streaking observed, usually due to necrosis and mineralization. Dark red: Congestion or hemorrhage Hemorrhagic necrosis Inflammation Hypostatic congestion (i.e. blood pooling due to gravity, and artifact found in postmortem examinations) Green: Putrefaction (rot) Eosinophilic inflammation (uncommon) The texture of diseased muscle can range from soft to hard (mineralized). Soft muscle can be indicative of necrosis, or potentially fat infiltration. 1.5 Biopsy techniques As noted above, a biopsy of muscle should always accompany any suspected muscular disease. Muscle is highly susceptible to artifact, but proper preparation of the sample can help in ensuring a diagnostic sample. Muscle retains the ability to contract after biopsy/death, and this contraction can result in artifactual histological changes that mimic true pathological changes. These changes, noted as contraction band artifact, can be prevented relatively easily: shortly after removal, secure the muscle to a rigid surface prior to fixation. A simple and manageable technique whether in the field or clinic is to place a strip of muscle along a tongue depressor, and anchor it into place using two needles (FIGURE XXX GET PICTURE), prior to placing the sample in formalin. As a general rule, a muscle biopsy should not exceed ~ 1 cm in diameter (with myofibers running lengthwise). "],

["circulatory-disturbances.html", "Chapter 3 Circulatory disturbances 3.1 Compartment syndrome 3.2 Downer syndrome 3.3 Postanestheic myopathy of horses", " Chapter 3 Circulatory disturbances Due to the high demand for oxygen and nutrient, skeletal muscle is a relatively well vascularized tissue (as you will find out when you cut a muscle belly during surgery!). This makes it somewhat resistant to vascular injury, as there is substantial collateral circulation: each myofiber is supplied by 3-12 capillaries. Thus, for the most part, ischemic damage to muscle is due to pressure over large surfaces of the body. Thromboembolic occlusion of a large vessel, most commonly seen at the aortoiliac junction in cats (and horses), can also lead to ischemic necrosis of large areas of muscle. 3.1 Compartment syndrome Compartment syndrome occurs most commonly in chickens and humans. As discussed in the section on [Anatomy of muscle], muscles are covered by various layers of connective tissue. Some muscles – the supracoracoid muscles in chickens, for example – are surrounded by inelastic tissues. In the case of the supracoracoid, the breastbone on one side, and a relatively rigid outer sheath encase the muscle in a fixed “compartment”. In the case of the chicken, short, vigorous exercise (wing flapping) is enough to increase intramuscular pressure significantly, collapsing veins and decreasing venous outflow. On top of this, muscle contraction can increase the diameter of myofibers by 20%, and in a restricted compartment, this contributes to further venous collapse. Increased muscular activity also increases arterial blood flow. The net result is increased arterial flow with decreased venous outflow leading to ischemic necrosis, all caused by a muscle held captive by rigid surrounding tissues. Damage to vessels subsequent to the necrosis can lead to interstitial edema, further increasing tissue pressure, and exacerbating the condition. Treatment (generally for humans) can involve a fasciotomy to relieve the pressure. 3.2 Downer syndrome Downer syndrome refers to ischemic myopathy caused by long periods of recumbency, leading to undue pressure on the dependent muscles. Size and weight of the animal are important factors: larger, well muscled animals are more prone to this syndrome than are thin animals. Cows are most frequently affected, while cats seem to be exempt. The pathogenesis is more complicated than initially meets the eye. The increased pressure on muscle capillaries caused by prolonged recumbency initially collapses veins, causing congestion and ischemia. Eventually arteries are affected as well, further contributing to the ischemic damage. If and when the animal changes positions and relieves the pressure, arteries are the first to recover, and the increased arterial pressure in the face of decreased venous outflow leads to edema, which itself can cause increased pressure and decreased venous outflow, further compounding the problem. Reperfusion injury also likely contributes to muscle damage. 3.3 Postanestheic myopathy of horses Horses that undergo prolonged anesthesia are prone to ischemic myopathy, especially if inadequate padding is used. Pressure on the muscle capillaries, caused by the weight of the horse, exceeds the pressure of perfusion, resulting in ischemia. The muscles affected depend on the position of the horse. Predisposing factors include intraoperative hypotension and the presence of comorbities, especially [Equine polysaccharide storage myopathy] and [Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis]. "],

["neoplasms-of-muscle.html", "Chapter 12 Neoplasms of muscle 12.1 Rhabdomyoma 12.2 Rhabdomyosarcoma 12.3 Tumours of the s 12.4 Secondary tumours", " Chapter 12 Neoplasms of muscle Primary neoplasms of the striated muscle are rare in veterinary species. Although usually found in muscle, they can arise in unexpected locations devoid of striated muscle, such as the bladder. 12.1 Rhabdomyoma As it’s name suggests, a rhabdomyoma is a benign tumour of striated muscle. It is seen most frequently in the hearts of pigs, particularly the red wattle breed and are typically incidental findings. They often present grossly as circumscribed, smooth-surfaced, nodular masses embedded in the myocardium. A similar neoplasm occasionally arises on the larynx of dogs. Laryngeal rhadomyomas may cause respiratory difficulty or altered bark. They are typically minimally invasive and tend not to metastasize. 12.2 Rhabdomyosarcoma These are the malignant counterparts to rhadomyomas. They are most common in the dog. Counterintuitively, they occur more frequently at sites that normally lack skeletal muscle versus those that don’t. There are a variety of subtypes, however, whether there is any prognostic significance to differentiating them is uncertain. They all tend to be locally invasive and metastatic. Prognosis is poor for all subtypes. Grossly, the tumours appear as pale, white to tan, firm masses, often with areas of necrosis. The botryoid (“cluster of grapes”) subtype occurs in the bladder as a polypoid mass. The histologic appearance of these tumours is quite variable, though occasionally elongated, variably striated, myotube-like cells known as “strap cells” are present, which is suggestive of rhadomyosarcoma. Immunohistochemistry is usually required to definitively diagnose these tumours. 12.3 Tumours of the s The supporting mesenchyme of muscle can occasionally produce a (usually) malignant neoplasm. Granular cell tumours occur in the tongue of dogs and cats. They are composed of densely packed round cells with PAS positive granules. Hemangiosarcomas can arise in the muscles of dogs and horses, and aspiration of these large, intramuscular masses typically only reveals hemorrhage. Like their splenic cousins, they metastasize frequently. 12.4 Secondary tumours Muscles are occasionally infiltrated by local neoplasms. Infiltrative lipomas are characterized by relatively well differentiated adipocytes crawling and invading through myofibers. They are highly invasive and require excision. Other neoplasms, such as subcutaneous mast cell tumours, lymphoma, hemangiosarcomas, and soft tissue sarcomas can invade into muscle. Metastasis to muscle is uncommon but does occur. "],
